Task 2.5 — Observations on Minimal-Topology Neural Networks

This experiment tested four neural-network tasks of increasing complexity.  
For each task, the minimal topology (fewest hidden nodes/layers) that achieved 
good accuracy on the test set is summarized below, along with reasoning.

──────────────────────────────
Task 2.1  – Linearly Separable (Square Dataset)
──────────────────────────────
Network Configuration:
• Learning Rate (α): 0.1  
• Hidden Layers: 1  
• Hidden Nodes: 32  
• Batch Size: 32  
• Epochs: 500  

Observation & Explanation:
The dataset is linearly separable; even a single hidden node can, in principle,
separate the two classes. However, due to stochastic training and sigmoid
nonlinearity, a small single-layer network with ~30 nodes reliably reached
> 98.5 % accuracy. Increasing layers did not improve performance but caused
slightly higher loss variance. Therefore, one hidden layer with minimal nodes
was sufficient.

──────────────────────────────
Task 2.2  – Non-Linear Boundary (Semi-Circle Dataset)
──────────────────────────────
Network Configuration:
• Learning Rate (α): 0.01  
• Hidden Layers: 2  
• Nodes per Layer: [32, 16]  
• Batch Size: 10  
• Epochs: 300  

Observation & Explanation:
The semi-circle data require a non-linear decision boundary. A two-layer
network (32 → 16 → 2) achieved stable accuracy (~98 %). Fewer layers could not
capture the curved separation boundary. Increasing layers or nodes yielded
marginal improvement but larger training time. Thus, two hidden layers of small
width were minimally sufficient.

──────────────────────────────
Task 2.3  – MNIST Handwritten Digits
──────────────────────────────
Network Configuration:
• Learning Rate (α): 0.01  
• Hidden Layers: 2  
• Nodes per Layer: [128, 64]  
• Batch Size: 64  
• Epochs: 200  

Observation & Explanation:
MNIST needs multiple non-linear transformations to distinguish digit patterns.
A shallow fully-connected net with 128 and 64 nodes achieved > 91 % accuracy.
Reducing nodes below 64 led to underfitting, whereas deeper networks offered
minimal gains relative to computation cost. Therefore, this configuration is
the smallest network yielding high performance.

──────────────────────────────
Task 2.4  – CIFAR-10 Images (3×32×32 Input)
──────────────────────────────
Network Configuration:
• Learning Rate (α): 0.1  
• Hidden Layers: (1 Conv + 1 FC Hidden)  
• Conv Layer: 8 filters of size 3×3 (stride 1)  
• Fully Connected Layers: [8×30×30 → 128 → 10]  
• Batch Size: 8  
• Epochs: 50  

Observation & Explanation:
CIFAR-10 contains complex color images requiring spatial feature extraction.
A single convolutional layer sufficed to capture local structure, followed by a
fully-connected layer for classification. Adding more conv/FC layers improved
accuracy marginally but increased parameters significantly. This setup provided
the minimal topology giving reasonable test accuracy (~35 - 40 %) for small
data subsets (5 k training samples).

Overall Conclusions:
──────────────────────────────
• As dataset complexity increased (Square → SemiCircle → MNIST → CIFAR-10),
  the minimal network depth and width also increased.  
• Simple linearly separable data need minimal nodes; curved or high-dimensional
  data require additional hidden layers to learn non-linear mappings.  
• Higher learning rates (0.1) were effective for simpler data; smaller rates
  (0.01) were required for complex tasks to ensure stable convergence.  
• Batch size influenced training stability: smaller batches worked better for
  small datasets, while larger batches improved efficiency on MNIST.

These results demonstrate the trade-off between model complexity and
generalization: minimal topology should balance sufficient representational
capacity with low overfitting risk.
