reference.txt

This file documents the modifications and references used in the Neural Network Lab (Task 2).

---------------------------------------
Files Modified
---------------------------------------

1. layers.py
   • Implemented forward and backward passes for:
       - FullyConnectedLayer
       - ConvolutionLayer
       - AvgPoolingLayer
   • Minor code cleanup and variable naming consistency.
   • Implementation logic discussed and reviewed with ChatGPT (OpenAI).

2. tasks.py
   • Completed Task 2.1 to Task 2.4 by defining NeuralNetwork architectures
     with tuned hyperparameters.
   • Architectures and parameters verified using ChatGPT suggestions and
     adjusted through testing.
   • Added comments for clarity and reproducibility.

3. nn.py
   • Minor modifications in train() and saveModel() functions to fix
     model saving using allow_pickle=True.
   • Added print statements for debugging and validation checks.

References Used
---------------------------------------
1. ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2025): Used for guidance on neural network architecture tuning,
   hyperparameter selection, and code corrections for layers.py and tasks.py.
2. Numpy Documentation: https://numpy.org/doc/
3. Course-provided templates and assignment instructions.
4. General references for activation functions and backpropagation:
   - "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow et al.
   - CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks Notes (Stanford University).

Declaration
---------------------------------------
I confirm that all core implementations were written by me,
and any external assistance (such as ChatGPT explanations or documentation)
was used only for understanding and debugging purposes.
